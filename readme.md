# Project Name: Lab4_choropleth_Co2


#### This project is an interactive webmap that displays CO2 emission data for every US state on a chloropleth map. This is displayed in 6 classes using Jenks natural breakpoints method of classification. The map colors are also colorblind safe. In the map you can hover over states to read the CO2 emissions for each state. Clicking on any state zooms in to fit it on screen. The map also has basic interaction like zoom and pan.
